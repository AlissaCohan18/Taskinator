# The Taskinator

## Description

The site is intended to be used for tracking To-Do List Items. You can add your own tasks, select what category they fall into (vacation, chores, or learning to code). Additionally, as progress is made on the tasks, the status can be updated and they will automatically flow through the kanban board accordingly.
